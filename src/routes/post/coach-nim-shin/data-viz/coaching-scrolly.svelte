This was the result of a prolonged dispute over the dual league system in Indonesia.

Fortunately, under Riedl's leadership, the team rebounded, reaching the AFF Championship final and climbing 20 places in the rankings. Despite this progress, he was dismissed at the end of 2016 as PSSI sought a younger coach with a long-term vision.",

Despite making significant progress and delivering the nation's best Asia Games performance, he was dismissed after a relatively short tenure. His departure was primarily due to failing to meet PSSIâ€™s lofty expectations and challenges in sustaining his substantial salary.",

In response, Milla's assistant, Bima Sakti, was appointed to lead the squad. The homegrown coach secured friendly victory against Myanmar but endured a disastrous AFF campaign, failing to advance beyond the group stage.",

He was replaced by Simon McMenemy, a coach who had just won Liga 1 and possessed experience in ASEAN football. However, his tenure proved disastrous.
